                <p> Starting with a good base is key. At commercial companies they
                    have their base made and you just follow their recipes and mix.
                </p>
                <p>Then you roll the dough out and cut to the shapes you desire.
                    Remember to let your dough rest through the process, from
                    letting the dough rest after mixing, before you cut your shapes,
                    to letting it proof properly. This is part of what creates the
                    fluffiness and melt-in-your-mouth taste. Totally worth the wait!
                </p>
                <p>There are several recipes for doughnuts that anyone can find
                    online. Try them out and find your favorite one! </p>
                <h2>Cooking/Frying</h2>
                <p>Another important factor to making donuts is the kind of oil you
                    fry in and the temperature that you use. Most commercial
                    companies have a donut frying oil that can be a mix of oils that
                    look similar to Crisco that are formulated for high temperatures
                    and have a neutral flavor.</p>
                <p>For frying at home, canola oil is a great neutral oil that can
                    handle high temperatures. Most frying temperatures for donuts
                    range from 340 to 370 degrees fahrenheit.</p>
                <p>Commercial fryers are large and can handle a large capacity of
                    frying donuts at one time. At home, use a deep pan, like a dutch
                    oven, that you can fry in with high sides that will less likely
                    to splash on you and cause burns. Make sure to fry each side
                    until a nice golden brown color. A fun way at work and at home
                    are flipping donuts with wooden sticks.</p>
                <p>Just remember to be careful with the hot oil, especially at home
                    if there are little ones around, because you can get severe
                    burns from the oil.</p>

                    donuts!</p>
