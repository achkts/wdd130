    <h2>Audrey</h2>
    <p>I love playing in local orchestras and pit orchestras for musicals. I play the trombone and cello. I love learning about everything, cooking, baking, decorating donuts, walking among the trees, time in the mountains, a good rainstorm, and the sounds of birds.I am married with six children, a cat, a dog, and twenty-two chickens! I grew up in a small town in Kansas and love blue skies and wide open spaces. I currently live in Riverton, Utah, just south of Salt Lake City. I recently had a career in decorating donuts, frying them and training others at a local bakery, but have switched to pursuing my BS in Applied Technology with BYU-Idaho. "Every Member a Missionary." - President David. O. McKay. I love this quote and my family really instilled this in me and are great examples of that. I love missionary work in all its varieties in this church, from Temple work to friends, neighbors and coworkers. I love being a friend to all no matter where you live, your background or beliefs.</p>
